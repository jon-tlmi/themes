#Core CSS directory
The CSS here will replace what is stored in /core with your own goodies.
Hopefully what I've show here is that it's not necessary to completely re-write the core css - you can just replace the classes you want easily.

>Tip: be careful if you copy over the /core/css/styles.css here because it contains a lot of links to all the icons, overlays and other goodies in core which are relative links - you will then have to either a) remove those references, or b) create or copy the relevant images to [theme name]/core/img/[file names]
